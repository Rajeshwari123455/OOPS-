import the abc module to create the abstract base class.create the car class that inherits the abc class and defined an abstract method named mileage().inherit the base class from the three diffrent subclasses and implment the abstract method differently.create the objects to call abstarct method



from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Vehicle(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def mileage(self):
        pass

class Sedan(Vehicle):
    def mileage(self):
        return 25

class SUV(Vehicle):
    def mileage(self):
        return 18

class Truck(Vehicle):
    def mileage(self):
        return 12
sedan = Sedan()
suv = SUV()
truck = Truck()

print("Mileage of Sedan:", sedan.mileage())
print("Mileage of SUV:", suv.mileage())
print("Mileage of Truck:", truck.mileage())
